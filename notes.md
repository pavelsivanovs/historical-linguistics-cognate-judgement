# Automated Cognate Recognition

## Task

**Devise**,  **implement** and **evaluate** a novel or known algorithm for ACJ (Automated
Cognate Judgement). We are free to choose or design a sensible method ourselves
in accordance with our ideas on how to approach the problem. 

We have to use the human-made cognate judgements supplied with the datasets as
the gold standard, to evaluate the accuracy of our methods. Our project should
contain the following points:

* Motivation for the choice of methods
* An implementation of the actual methods
* An evaluation of the methods on at least one of the datasets
* Some analysis of the successes and failures of the methods

### Possible extensions

* Experiment with different (directed?) phonetic distances
* Extract potential sound correspondences from the cognate sets
* Address the problems of meaning change and/or non-monomorphemic forms in ACJ
* Go beyond pairwise alignment towards the alignment of more than two forms
* Analyze the methods(s) performance across different datasets
